## Purpose
Complete the questions in the weekly problem set in order to practice concepts learned in class.

## Build and Run Commands
Special commands used were malloc and atoi

## Caveats
I didn't get the 3rd one fully working because I wasn't sure how to integrate atoi and count the 
cases where there were 2 integers like 99. I did get the 100 to work nicely. 

## Acknowledgements
Claude, Edward and I worked on this together in study sessions. We brainstormed and helped each other. 
I actually did not use online sources this time. I consider it a level-up. I did use the class slides and examples. 
I did look up atoi but didn't really get it to work.
