Granular Synthesis Using PortAudio In C

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've done some research into what granular synthesis actually is and looked at some higher level implementations of it. I've also started looking into possibly using PortAudio to implement a way to cut up an audio into small grains, store it in a folder and then recall it and play it back. I've found one implementations of it in C but it first had a synthesizer that then had a grains.c executable file. So I'm not sure exactly what I need to do. I think I need to consult you on a direction. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't started to test the ideas yet. I need to start a draft soon and work out if it is actually possible to do this with port audio. I've found a lot of implementations of granular synthesis in C++ but I haven't found one in C yet. I think that I can do it using PortAudio and some sort of slicing/copying procedure but I'm not sure exactly how to do that. I also think there will be limited features because I've been stuck on this stage for a while. I then think I need to map out exactly how I'm going to approach making this project in smaller steps so that I don't get lost in the process. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I don't have a very solid understanding of PortAudio so I'm not sure if I can implement in it yet. So I'm going to keep researching and learning about PortAudio and I think that will help immensely.
