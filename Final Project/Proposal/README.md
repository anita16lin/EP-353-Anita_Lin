# Proposal

### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Granular Synthesizer using PortAudio and PortMidi   

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A granular synthesizer that takes in a sample and granularizes it according to different settings. 

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a basic granular synthesizer that take in a sample. It will then process the sample by choosing the size of the window, the rate of scanning and such. I will research into more details about granular synthesis implementated in different programs and in C. It will be using PortAudio and PortMIDI. 

### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have something that reads the file and breaks it down into little bits and plays it back. Just a granular synthesizer at the most basic form. 

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better form would be that it has more detailed parameters like controlling the size of the grains, the rate that the grains are processed, and more. 

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is to have the most basic form of granular synthesizer working without any errors. 

### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I am going to research more into granular synthesis. Then more into different implementations of granular synthesis that will help on the theory side and on the coding side. Then I will research more into PortAudio and PortMIDI and how to implement that.
