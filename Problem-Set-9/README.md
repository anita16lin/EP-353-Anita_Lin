2. Problem Set 9.1


## Purpose
Complete the questions in the weekly problem set in order to practice concepts learned in class.

## Build and Run Commands
Special commands used were malloc and atoi

## Caveats
I didn't really get a lot done this week on this problem set. I've been having a hard time these last couple weeks but I am turning in what I have because I've already spent a lot of time on this and I'm not sure what else to do. I keep geting a square wave and I'm not sure what to do about getting a triangle wave. I'm going to complete the other problems soon even though they will be late, I will definitely give them a try. I hope you can still accept them.
